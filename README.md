# MSc thesis code

This repo contains the code that supports the development of a master thesis on the development of a NMPC based method to control a wheeled mobile robot on unknown environments. The code is based on the intercomunication between ROS (Noetic) nodes. Each node runs a specific task. Python3.8 is the code based language.
